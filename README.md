# tic-tac-toe
This is my first attempt at working with React. 

I built a simple tic-tac-toe game using the following [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#taking-turns). 

The game is able to:
- Identify the next player after a move is made 
- Point out the winner 
- Track move history and go back to a previous step in the game 

In the future, I want to improve the styling, add more functionality and also allow sharing of results. 

Currently, I lack the knowledge to add features on my own and require some more practice. 

Here is a screenshot of what the game looks like:
